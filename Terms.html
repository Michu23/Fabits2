                                        IPO, there is no need to issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number
                                        and sign the IPO application form to authorize your bank to make payment in case
                                        of allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain in your bank
                                        account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have not authorized anyone
                                        to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone claiming to be part of Fabits
