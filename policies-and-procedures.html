                    NSE Equity: Shareway Securities Limited has a policy of giving up to 20 times exposure on a broad
                    spectrum of stocks; no margin is given for delivery trades. The client needs to have enough money in
                    his trading account to take delivery of shares failing which Shareway Securities Limited can cut the
                    position. Comprehensive real-time margins at Shareway Securities Limited can be viewed

                    a situation arising, the onus of squaring off the position will be on the Client. Our RMS desk shall
                    square off any such position, without the requirement of a margin call, if the necessary cash is not

                        For all pledge requests placed before 4:00 PM, the collateral margin will be available to trade
                        on T+1 day (next working day). All requests placed after 4:00 PM will be processed only on the
                        next working day.

                        Margins will be provided after the applicable haircut. You can click here for the applicable
                        haircut on various stocks. A haircut of 10% would mean that if you pledged stocks worth Rs 1
                        lakh, Rs 90,000 (90% of 1 lakh) will be added as collateral margin to your trading account.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        You can see this margin under the heading Direct Collateral on our trading platforms Pi
                        (desktop), (Web/mobile), and NEST.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        You will be able to use this entire margin after haircut for taking intraday or overnight
                        positions in Futures, and for writing Options of equities, indices, and currencies. You will not
                        be able to use this margin to buy Options or take further positions on the equity segment.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Exchanges stipulate that for overnight F&O positions, 50% of the margin needs to compulsorily
                        come in cash and the remaining 50% can be in terms of collateral margin. If you don’t have
                        enough cash, your account will be in debit balance and there will be an delayed payment
                        (interest) charges charge of 0.05% per day applicable on the debit amount. So, if you take
                        positions that requires a margin of Rs 1 lakh, you will need at least Rs 50,000 in cash
                        irrespective of how much collateral margin you have. Assuming you don’t have this Rs 50,000,
                        whatever you are short by will be the debit balance for the day, and delayed payment (interest)
                        charges will be applicable for that amount. You can check this link to know more on how the
                        delayed payment (interest) charges will be computed.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Liquid funds are considered as cash equivalents by the exchange, so the above 50% rule wouldn’t
                        apply. The Margin received from pledging liquid funds will be as good as having cash in your
                        trading account. All cash equivalent stocks are updated here.

                    <li>

                        All delayed payment (interest) charges accumulated will be debited once every month on the
                        ledger. A link to see cumulative delayed payment (interest) charges calculation can be found on

                        All pledged stocks are marked as pledge in the client’s demat account until they are unpledged.
                        The process of pledging will cost ₹30 plus GST per scrip irrespective of the quantity, and there
                        is no charge for unpledged. So if you pledge 100 shares of Infosys and 200 shares of Reliance,
                        the cost for pledging is ₹60 plus GST (30*2). This charge will be debited from your ledger the
                        day the pledge request is processed.

                <p>
                    Shareway Securities Limited follows the practice of posting the settlement obligation towards their
                    transaction in the client ledger on the settlement date. All clients are advised to make the payment
                    before the pay-in time on the settlement day, though there are instances wherein client may delay
                    the payment beyond the settlement date. Although, it is obligatory for a broker to meet the
                    settlement obligation in time, therefore, in order to ensure timely receipt of funds from clients
                    towards their payment obligation, “charges for delayed payment” are levied in the client’s account.
                    The sum towards “charges for delayed payment” is levied to discourage delayed payment from clients
                    who do not deposit the required sum of money before the pay in time on the pay in day. “Charges for
                    delayed payment” are levied on the respective ledger debit of the clients at a rate of 0.05% per day
                    of the debit balance in the account. For the purpose of reckoning debit balance, the debit balance
                    in the client ledger is consolidated across all segments of the respective exchange after giving
                    effect to the release of margin.

                    Shareway Securities Limited brief
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shareway Securities Limited has introduced the concept Investment boxes to choose in various schemes
                    for the first time in India. Our focus is on helping Investor stay invested and gain out of the
                    capital markets ahead of the rest of the pack by offering innovative solutions to the problems that
                    exist in the trading domain.
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to create Shareway Securities Limited based on an in-depth understanding of how the odds
                    are always stacked against active traders in the financial markets. A study conducted by us revealed
                    that almost 90% of active traders in the markets lose money in the long run. One of the fundamental
                    drivers that define this reality is the fact that brokerages in India have always charged traders a
                    percentage brokerage, regardless of if one makes or loses money on a particular trade. This insight
                    inspired us to create a whole new way of trading.
